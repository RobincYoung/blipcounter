# blipcounter
counts 'blips' (change in voltage on pin 8) and displays the average over the last 10 seconds using 'LiquidCrystal'
see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HelloWorld for setup
every time pin 8 changes from 1 to 0 (defults to 0) twice within a 1 milisecond it is counted and the average total per second is displayed on a screen
